JS30 Day 3. Updating CSS Variables for spacing, blur, and base color using JS. 

A project I completed on Sep 6 2019, Day #3 of 30 days of code in the JavaScript30.com class. In this exercise I learned how to create and use CSS variables. I also continued to practice editing CSS, listening for different kinds of events (change and mousemove), and reading data attributes using the dataset property with JS.
